00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,710
Welcome to the section about getting started with

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,540
And before we take a look at the block project that you going to be building in the session

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,680
Let's talk in general about

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,690
Why would you want to use a web framework in the first place

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,370
The reason for this instead the web

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,230
As a structure as a system grew organically like it started

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,690
The little seedling

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,530
Kept growing over time

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,600
Until they're like lots of new Technologies

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,300
Getting stuck on top of each other and can I like

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,340
Arrange to inter operate that is HTML CSS JavaScript

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,150
The databases that you have to interact with

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,290
There are back-end languages

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,980
Doesn't like Python this one of those steps

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,010
This database interactions with sequel

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,050
And it just kept growing and growing so that it's

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,770
Very very very big thing

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,490
Really

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,540
Complex mess

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,520
It's hard to get a grass but what's going on

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,440
And how do I cancel everything that needs to fit together

22
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,740
Probably works when tap or

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Anything that you want to publish and there's just so much that goes into dead

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,930
The idea of a web framework is

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Essentially

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,460
Automate repetitive web development tasks

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,720
It allows you to extract database interactions so you maybe don't have to write sequel

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,410
Is a pure language than cutting down one of them

29
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,770
Languages you need to know for web development

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,320
It handles your request and your elves nothing for you

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,320
Templating framework

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,670
Accent allowed to do to generate HTML sites on the go

33
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,500
With like a language that is more familiar to you

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
And it helps

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,010
With security caching sessions at

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,930
With all of these things

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,580
And to

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,830
Sum it up in one

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,790
Web development

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,510
Web frameworks

41
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,380
Is web development

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,090
That's why you would want to work in general

43
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,450
And the next video we going to talk about why you would want Django as a web framework

44
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,640


45
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,500


46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,880


47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,850
