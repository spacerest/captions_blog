00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,584
Welcome to the section about getting started

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,352
Django

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,264
And before we take a look at the block project that you going to be building in the session let's just

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
In general about

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
Why would you not use a web frame

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
In the first

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
So

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
The reason for this instead the web

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,040
As a structure as a system grow organically like it start

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
The little seedling

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
Kept growing over time

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,440
Until they're like lots of new technology

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,256
Getting stuck on top of each other and can I like

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:37,120
Arrange to inter operator as HTML CSS JavaScript

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,936
The databases that you have to interact with

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,984
There are back-end language

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,800
Doesn't like Python this one of those steps

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
This database interactions with sequel

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
And it just kept growing and growing so that it's

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
Very very very big thing

21
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
Really

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Complex

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
It's hard to get a grass but what's going on and how do you like handle everything that needs to fit together

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,536
Only works when tap or anything that you want to publish and there's just so much that goes in

25
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
The idea of a web framework is

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,216
Essentially just automate repetitive web development task

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
It allows you to extract database interactions so you maybe don't have the right

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,712
Sequel as a pure language the cutting down one of the languages you need to know for web development

29
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,296
It handles your request and your elves nothing for you

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,672
Templating frameworks and allows you to generate HTML sites on the go

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
With like a language that is more familiar to you

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
And it

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,888
With security caching sessions that help you with all these things

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
And to

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
Sum it up in one go

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Web development

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Is a mess

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
And with friends

39
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
Is web development simple

40
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
That's why you would want

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Web framework in general

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
And the next video we going to talk about why you would want to go as well
